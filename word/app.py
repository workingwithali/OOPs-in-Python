# Defining the personal statement text
personal_statement = """
As a dedicated Software Engineering student at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, I have developed a strong foundation in web development, problem-solving, and UI/UX design through internships, including one at WebEx. I have also participated in four international hackathons, which have sharpened my technical and teamwork skills. Alongside my academic journey, I have embraced challenges in the gym, using struggle training as a personal discipline to build resilience.

My ultimate goal is to become an AI and software engineer, with a vision to advance the software industry in Pakistan. The UGRAD scholarship provides a unique opportunity for me to gain global exposure, professional skills, and cross-cultural experience. Studying in the U.S. will broaden my perspective, allowing me to integrate innovative solutions back into Pakistan's growing tech sector.

The cultural exchange aspect of UGRAD is significant to me. It will allow me to share the rich cultural heritage of Pakistan, while learning about the diversity and inclusiveness of American culture. Professionally, I will gain access to advanced educational resources and industry expertise, which will help me stay at the forefront of emerging technologies. Personally, UGRAD will boost my confidence, improve my communication skills, and empower me to contribute more meaningfully to my community and the global tech landscape
